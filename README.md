# AlgebraNotes
Notes taken from algebra lectures at KAIST.

I took MAS311 and MAS312 during the 2023 semesters. I am very interested by the content despite it being difficult. 
The courses were instructed by professor S. Baek. I compiled the note taken in the classes into a summary, 
`galois.tex`, and rendered as `galois.pdf` for anyone interested to take a look. 

I will also upload my answers to some selected questions, although they were not my latest work. Even some of my latest works did not get checked, and 
some did get checked to be wrong. I will not edit them and just provide them "as-is". 

Later on I took MAS511 and this pushed my interest further. It's a shame that I can't (or won't) do math now but still enjoy it.
I am adding some notes from this subject as well.
