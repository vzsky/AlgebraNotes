# AlgebraNotes
Notes taken from modern algebra lectures at KAIST.

I took MAS311 and MAS312 during the 2023 semesters. I am very interested by the content despite it being difficult. 
The courses were instructed by professor S. Baek. I compiled the note taken in the classes into a summary, 
`galois.tex`, and rendered as `galois.pdf` for anyone interested to take a look. 

I will also upload my answers to some selected questions, although they were not my latest work. Even some of my latest works did not get checked, and 
some did get checked to be wrong. I will not edit them and just provide them "as-is".

Also, the template was taken from 
[SenoirMars](https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/master/latex_template)
and modified, feel free to copy it forward in case you need, don't forget to check the OG for cool note taking tips.

PRs are very appreciated, help fix my work!
