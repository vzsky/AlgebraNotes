    Let $R$ be a domain which is not a field. Prove that $R[x]$ is not a principal ideal doamin.
  }
  \sol{
    Since $R$ is not a field, there is a non-zero $a$ such that $a \not\in R^\times$. 
    Let $I$ be the ideal generated by $a$ and $x$. If $I$ is principal, then $I = bR[x]$ for some $b \in R[x]$.
    Let $b = b_x x + b_0$, then consider $x \in I$, so $x = f(b_x x + b_0)$ for some $f = \sum_{i=0}^k f_ix^i$. 
    Since $a$ is non-zero, $b_0$ is non-zero. $R$ is a domain, $f_0$ must be $0$. 
    But then $f_i$ for $1 \le i \le k$ must be $0$ since $f_i x^i (b_x x)$ must be $0$.
    This means that $f = 0$, but $0(b_x x + b_0) \ne x$. Thus $I$ cannot be principal.

    Let $S$ be a multiplicative subset of a principal ideal domain $R$. Show that the localization $S^{-1}R$ is also a principal domain.
  }
  \sol{
    Let $J$ be an ideal $\set{\frac{a/s}}$ in $S^{-1}R$. If $\frac{a}{s} \in J$, then $\frac{a}{s}\cdot\frac{s}{1} = \frac{a}{1} \in J$, 
    because $J$ is an ideal. Then, let $I = \set{a \mid \frac{a}{1} \in J} \subset R$. Then, $0 \in I$. Moreover, if $a, b \in I$ and 
    $r \in R$, then $\frac{a}{1}, \frac{b}{1} \in J$, and $\frac{r}{1} \in S^{-1}R$. 
    Therefore, $\frac{ab}{1}, \frac{a-b}{1}, \frac{ar}{1} \in J$, which means that $ab, a-b, ar \in I$. Thus, $I$ is an ideal of $R$.

    Now, assume that $I$ is principal, and $I = aR$ for some element $a \in R$.
    Then, for any element $\frac{b}{s} \in J$, it is true that $\frac{b}{s} = \frac{b}{1}\frac{1}{s}$ where $\frac{1}{s} \in S^{-1}R$.
    Thus, if $\frac{b}{1} \in J$, then $\frac{b}{s} \in J$. However, if since $b \in I$, $b = ax$ for some element $x \in R$. 
    Which means that $\frac{b}{1} = \frac{a}{1}\frac{x}{1}$ for some $\frac{x}{1} \in S^{-1}R$. Thus, any element of $J$ is generated by 
    $\frac{a}{1}$. So, $S^{-1}R$ is a principal ideal domain.

    Show that $R = \set{a + b\theta \mid \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}, a, b \in \Int }$ is not a Euclidean domain.

    $R$ is a Euclidean domain with $\phi$. Choose $a \in R$ such that $\phi(a)$ is the smallest integer in 
    $\set{ \phi(x) \mid x \ne 0, x \not\in R^\times}$. Show that there exist no $q$ and $r$ such that $2 = aq + r$ with $r = 0$ or 
    $\phi(r) < \phi(a)$) 
  }
  \sol{
    Firstly, consider that 
    \[ \theta^2 = \paren{ \frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2} }^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{-19} -19}{4} = \frac{-9 + \sqrt{-19}}{2} = \theta  - 5 \]
    Then, for $x = a + b\theta$, let $N(x) = a^2 + 5b^2 + ab$, so that $N$ is multiplicative.
    Let $y = c + d\theta$, then 
    \eqs{
      N(xy) &= N((a + b\theta)(c + d\theta)) \\ 
            &= N((ac - 5bd) + (ad + cb + bd)\theta) \\ 
            &= (ac - 5bd)^2 + 5(ad + cb + bd)^2 + (ac - 5bd)(ad + cb + bd) \\ 
            &= a^2c^2 - 10abcd + 25b^2d^2 + 5a^2d^2 + 5c^2b^2 + 5b^2d^2 + 10abcd + 10b^2cd + 10abd^2  \\ 
            &\;\;\;\; + a^2cd + abc^2 - 5abd^2 - 5b^2cd - 5b^2d^2 \\
            &= a^2c^2 + abcd + 25b^2d^2 + 5a^2d^2 + 5c^2b^2 + 5b^2cd + 5abd^2 + a^2cd + abc^2 \\ 
            &= a^2c^2 + 5b^2c^2  +abc^2 + 5a^2d^2 + 25b^2d^2 + 5abc^2 + a^2cd + 5b^2cd + abcd \\
            &= (a^2 + 5b^2 + ab)(c^2 + 5d^2 + cd) \\
            &= N(x)N(y)
    }
    Note also that for any $0 \ne x \in R$, it follows that $N(x) \ge 1$ since 
    \[ N(x) = a^2 + 5b^2 + ab = \paren{a + \frac{b}{2}}^2 + 19\paren{\frac{b}{2}}^2 \ge 1 \]

    Moreover, $N(1) = 1$, so if $x \in R^\times$, then $N(x) = 1$. 
    Now, if $x = a + b\theta$, then $b > 0$ implies $N(x) > 1$, and if $b = 0$, $N(x) = a^2 = 1$ only for $a = \pm 1$. 
    So the only solutions for $N(x) = 1$ are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$. Then, it is easy to check that $-1 \cdots -1 = 1$, 
    thus $-1 \in R^\times$. Therefore, $R^\times = \set{\pm 1}$

    Assume for contradiction that $R$ is a Euclidean Domain with $\phi$. Then let $0 \ne a \not\in R^\times$ be the element with 
    $\phi(a)$ being smallest in the set $\set{ \phi(x) \mid x \ne 0, x \not\in R^\times }$. 

    Note for future usage that there is no element $x \in R$ for which $N(x) = 2$ or $N(x) = 3$. 
    This is due to the fact that if that there is, then let that element be $a + b\theta$. 
    Now, $(a + b/2)^2 + 19(b/2)^2 \le 3$, so $b = 0$ otherwise $19(b/2)^2 > 3$. but then there is no $a^2 = 2$
    and no $a^2 = 3$ for $a \in \Int$, thus a contradiction.

    Now, let $2 = aq + r$. If $r = 0$, then $2 = aq$. This could happen only if $N(a) = 2$ or $N(a) = 4$ since $N(2) = 4$.
    However, there is no element with $N(x) = 2$, so $N(a) = 4$. Now, consider $\theta = aq' + r'$. 
    Since $N(\theta) = 5$, then $r' \ne 0$ because $N(a) \nmid N(\theta)$.
    But because of the minimality of $a$, $r$ must be a unit. Now, $N(\theta + 1) = 7$ and $N(\theta - 1) = 5$ are both prime.
    This means that $N(a) \nmid N(\theta + 1)$ and $N(a) \nmid N(\theta - 1)$, so $\theta \ne aq' + r'$ for any $q', r' \in R$.

    In the other case, if $r \ne 0$, then $r \in R^\times$ is forced as otherwise $\phi(r) \ge \phi(a)$.
    So either $1 = aq$ or $3 = aq$. However, $a$ is not a unit, thus $1 \ne aq$ for any $q \in R$.
    If $3 = aq$, then $9 = N(3) = N(a)N(q)$, which is that $N(a) = 3$ or $N(a) = 9$. However, there is no element with $N(x) = 3$. 
    So it must be the case that $N(a) = 9$.
    But then, consider $\theta = aq' + r'$. Notice that as $N(\theta) = 5$, then $r' \ne 0$, which means that $r' \in R^\times$.
    But $N(a) \nmid N(\theta + 1)$ and $N(a) \nmid N(\theta - 1)$, so $\theta \ne aq' + r'$ for any $q', r' \in R$. 

    This contradiction showed that $R$ is not a euclidean domain.

    Let $R$ be a domain. Show that $R$ is a unique factorization domain if and only if every irreducible element of $R$ is prime

      If $R$ is a unique factorization domain, then every irreducible element of $R$ is prime. 
      Consider if $p$ is an irreducible element and $p \mid xy$ for some $x, y \in R$, then $xy = pz$ for some $z \in R$. 
      Now, as $R$ is a unique factorization domain, write $x = ua_1\cdots a_n$, $y=vb_1\cdots b_m$, and 
      $z = wc_1\cdots c_k$ for unit $u, v, w$ and irreducible elements $a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_m, c_1, \ldots, c_k$.
      Then, \[ (uvw^{-1})a_1\ldots a_n b_1 \ldots b_m = p c_1 \cdots c_k \]
      So by uniqueness of factorization, $p \sim a_i$ or $p \sim b_i$ for some $i$, which means either $p \mid x$ or $p \mid y$.

      Next, let $C$ be a chain of principal ideal $I_1 \subset \cdots$, and let $I_i = a_iR$ for some element $a_i \in R$.
      By the property of UFD, $a_1 = u_1c_1 \cdots c_n$ for irreducible element. Then, as $aR \subset bR$ means $b \mid a$, then 
      $a_n | a_1$ for any $n > 1$, but then $a_n = u_nc_1\cdots c_{k_n}$ for some $0 \le k_n \le n$.
      Note that $k_n = 0$ means $a_n = u_n$

      Then, let $K = \set{k_n \mid a_n = u_nc_1 \cdots c_{k_n}, \; \forall n}$. Since $K \subset {0, 1, \cdots, n}$, there is a minimal 
      element by the well ordering principal, let that element be $k$, and $a_m = u_mc_1 \cdots c_k$.
      Now, if there is some $m' > m$ such that $I_{m'} \ne I_m$, then $I_m \subsetneq I_{m'}$, which means that
      $m' \mid m$ and $m \nmid m'$. This means that $a_{m'} = u_{m'}c_1 \cdots c_{k'}$ for some $k' < k$. This is a contradiction.
      Hence, $I_m = I_{m+1} = \cdots$ terminates the chain $C$ finitely. 
    }{ 
      Let $S = \set{aR \mid a \ne 0, a \notin R^\times, a \text{ is not a product of irreducibles} }$.
      If $S \ne \emptyset$, 
      then there is a maximal element of $S$ because every chain $C \subset S$ terminates finitely. Let $bR$ be a maximal element of 
      $S$ for some $b \in R$. Then, $bR \in S$, so $b$ is not irreducible, so $b = xy$ for some nonunit $x, y$.
      This means that $bR \subsetneq xR$ and $bR \subsetneq yR$, as if $bR = xR$, then $y$ is a unit, 
      and similar logic prevents $bR = yR$.

      By the maximality of $bR$, $x$ and $y$ must be a product of irreducibles. Therefore, $b$ is a product of irreducible, which gives
      contradiction. Therefore, $S = \emptyset$, which means that $S$ is a factorization domain.

      Now, assume that $uc_1\cdots c_n = vd_1 \cdots d_m$ where $c_1, \ldots, c_n, d_1, \ldots, d_m$ are irreducible, then,
      they are also prime by assumption. 
      Now, consider that $c_n$ divides $d_i$ for some $i$ as they are prime, then, assume without loss of generality that $c_n \mid d_m$.
      Then, $uc_1 \cdots c_n = vwd_1 \cdots d_{m-1}c_n$, which is that $u c_1 \cdots c_{n-1} = vwd_1 \cdots d_{m-1}$. 
      By induction hypothesis, $c_1 \cdots c_{n-1}$ is a unique factorization, thus $c_1 \cdots c_n$ is a unique factorization. 
      Notice that basic case that $u c_1 = v d_1$ is unique by definition of irreducibility.
      Therefore, the domain is a UFD.

    In other words, $R$ is generated by the set above.

    Then $R$ is a ring by construction, which is that the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication is a part of $R$.

    Note that $R \subset \set{\sum_{i=0}a_i{b_i^{r_i}} \mid a_i \in \Int, b_i \in \Nat, r_i \in \Real^+}$.

    And since for $r_i \in \Rat^+$, $b_i^{r_i}$ is algebraic in $\Real/\Int$, it follows that
    $R \subset \set{a \mid a \text{ is algebraic in } \Real/\Int}$ , which is a field, then $R$ must contain no zero divisor,

    Let $r$ be irreducible, then $r \ne 1$, then $r = \sqrt{r} \sqrt{r}$ with $\sqrt{r} \notin R^\times$. Thus, $r$ is not irreducible.

    Assume for contradiction that $R[[x]]$ is not Noetherian, thus there is a chain $ I_1 \subsetneq I_2 \subsetneq \cdots $
    that does not terminate. 
    Now, consider $\phi: R[[x]] \to R$ given by $f = 0 + 0 + \cdots + a_nx^n + \cdots \mapsto a_n$ where $n$ is the lowest term with 
    non-zero coefficient. 
    Then, $\phi(I_i)$ is an ideal, since if $a \in \phi(I_i)$ and $b \in R$. Then there is $f = ax^n + \cdots, g = bx^m + \cdots$ 
    with lowest coefficient $a$ and $b$, where $f$ and $g$ is in $I_i$ and $R[[x]]$ respectively.
    So, there is polynomial $fg \in I_i$ which has lowest coefficient $ab$. Thus, $ab \in \phi(I_i)$.
    Also, if $a, b \in \phi(I_i)$, then there is $f = ax^n + \cdots, g = bx^m + \cdots$ in $I_i$. Then, let $n > m$ without loss of 
    generality. It follows that $f - gx^{n-m} = {a-b}x^n + \cdots$ is a polynomial in $I_i$. Thus, $a-b \in \phi(I_i)$.

    Now, let $J_i = \phi(I_i)$. Since $I_1 \subsetneq I_2 \subsetneq \cdots $, it follows that $J_1 \subseteq J_2 \subseteq \cdots$

    $\phi(I_k) \ne \phi(I_{k+1})$. Thus, for each of the finite generator of $J_n$, the polynomial with lowest nonzero coefficient
    being that generator has finite degree of lowest nonzero term. Finite sum of finite is finite. Thus, there can be only finitely many 
    $I_n = I_{n+1} = \cdots = I_{n+k}$, so the chain $I$ must stabilize at $I_{n+k}$.

    Thus, $xy, x-y, rx$ are elements of $J$. Thus, a preimage of an ideal is an ideal.

    Now, let proceed by contraposition. 
    If $S$ is not Noetherian, there exists a chain $I_1 \subsetneq I_2 \subsetneq \cdots$ that does not terminate.
    As if $x \in \phi^{-1}(I_i)$, then $\phi(x) \in I_i$, which means $\phi(x) \in I_j$ for every $j > i$. So, $x \in \phi^{-1}(I_j)$.
    Moreover, if there is an element $y \notin I_i$ but $y \in I_{i+1}$, then there must be an element $x \in R$ such that $\phi(x) = y$. 
    However, as $y \notin I_i$, $x \notin \phi^{-1}(I_i)$ but $x \in \phi^{-1}(I_{i+1})$. Thus, the chain is strict.
    Then, \[ \phi^{-1}(I_1) \subsetneq \phi^{-1}(I_2) \subsetneq \cdots \] is a chain of ideal that does not terminate, which means that 
    $R$ must also be non-noetherian.

        By the same argument, $r_0, \ldots, r_j$ must be all zero, but that means $r_i = 0$, contradicting that $r_i \ne r_0$.
        So, there must be no $j$ such that $s_j \ne 0$.

        are infinitely many monic irreducible polynomial.
        Otherwise, $F$ is a finite field.
        In this case, assume for contradiction that there are finitely many irreducible polynomial $f_1, \ldots, f_n$. 
        Then, $f = f_1 \cdots f_n + 1$ is an element of $F[x]$, which is a UFD. So, $f = f_i g$ for some $1 \le i \le n$ and polynomial 
        $g \in F[x]$. But as $f_i \mid f_1 \cdots f_n$, it must follow that $f_i \mid 1$, which contradict that $f_i$ is irreducible,
        thus a non-unit.

        Therefore, there are infinitely many irreducible polynomial.
        Now, since $F[x]^\times = F^\times = F - \set{0}$. There are finite, say $k$, unit in the field, namely $I_1, \ldots, I_k$.
        If there is a finite number of monic irreducible polynomial, $m_1, \ldots, m_n$, then all irreducible are 
        \[ I_1m_1, \ldots, I_1m_n, I_2m_1, \ldots, I_2m_n, \ldots, I_km_n \]
        Since if $I_1 f$ for any non-unit $f$ results obviously to a reducible element.
        As the result contradicts with the fact that there are infinitely many irreducible, then there must be also infinitely 
        many monic irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$.
