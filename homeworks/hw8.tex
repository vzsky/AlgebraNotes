    Let $[G,G]$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by all commutators. 
    Prove that $[G,G]$ is normal in $G$ and $G/[G,G]$ is abelian.
  }
  \sol{
    By definition, $[G,G]$ is the subgroup $\ang{\set{xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \mid x,y\in G}}$. Consider any $g \in G$, 
    and any element $h = [x_1,y_1]\cdots[x_k,y_k]$ in $[G,G]$, it follows that, 
    \begin{align*}
      ghg^{-1} = g ([x_1,y_1]\cdots[x_k,y_k]) g^{-1} &= g[x_1,y_1]g^{-1} \; g[x_2,y_2]g^{-1} \cdots g[x_k,y_k]g^{-1} \\
                                          &= gx_1y_1x_1^{-1}y_1^{-1}g^{-1} \cdots gx_ky_kx_k^{-1}y_k^{-1}g^{-1} \\ 
                                          &= gx_1g^{-1}gy_1g^{-1}gx_1^{-1}g^{-1}gy_1^{-1}g^{-1} \cdots 
                                          gx_kg^{-1}gy_kg^{-1}gx_k^{-1}g^{-1}gy_k^{-1}g^{-1} \\
                                          &= [gx_1g^{-1}, gy_1g^{-1}] \cdots [gx_kg^{-1}, gy_kg^{-1}] \\
    \end{align*}
    But as $gx_ig^{-1}$ and $gy_ig^{-1}$ is a member of $G$ for any $i$ by closure, it follows that for any $g \in G$, 
    $ghg^{-1}$ is a member of $[G,G]$ by definition. Thus, $g[G,G]g^{-1} \subseteq [G,G]$, but consider $ghg^{-1} = e$ if and 
    only if $h = e$, thus $[G,G] \subseteq g[G,G]g^{-1}$, which means that $[G,G]$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

    Next, consider the quotient set $G/[G,G] = \set{g[G,G] \mid g \in G}$, and let $g[G,G]$ and $h[G,G]$ be the element of 
    $G/[G,G]$. Consider that $g[G,G] \cdot h[G,G] = gh[G,G]$. 
    As $h^{-1}, g^{-1} \in G$, then $[h^{-1}, g^{-1}] \in [G,G]$, it follows that 
    $gh[h^{-1}, g^{-1}] \in gh[G,G]$ but \[ gh[h^{-1}, g^{-1}] = ghh^{-1}g^{-1}hg = hg \]
    Moreover, since $hg \in hg[G,G]$ and the coset are mutually exclusive, it follows that $gh[G,G] = hg[G,G]$. 
    Thus, $G/[G,G]$ is abelian.

    \clm[conjcyc]{
      Two element $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ of $S_n$ are in the same conjugacy class if they share the same cycle structure.
      \pf{
        Let $\sigma = (a_{11}\cdots a_{1n_1}) \cdots (a_{r1}\cdots a_{rn_r})$ be an element of $S_n$ 
        where each cycle $(a_{i1} \cdots a_{in_i})$ is pairwise disjoint to the other cycle. 
        Then for any $\tau \in S_n$, 
        \[ \tau \sigma \tau^{-1} 
          = \tau (a_{11}\cdots a_{1n_1})\cdots(a_{r1} \cdots a_{rn_r}) \tau^{-1}
          = \tau (a_{11} \cdots a_{1n_1}) \tau^{-1} \cdots \tau (a_{r1} \cdots a_{rn_r}) \tau^{-1} \]
        Which maps 
        $\tau(a_{ij}) \to[$\tau^{-1}$] a_{ij} \to[$\sigma$] a_{i(j+1)} \to[$\tau$] \tau(a_{i(j+1)})$ for each $i$. 
        Thus, \[ \tau\sigma\tau^{-1} = (\tau(a_{11}) \cdots \tau(a_{1n_1}))\cdots(\tau(a_{r1})\cdots \tau(a_{rn_r})) \]

        Moreover, it is possible to choose $\tau$ so that the resulting $\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}$ is any cycle of that cycle type,
        as $\tau \in S_n$.
      }
    }
    
    From the claim, it follows that the conjugacy class of $S_5$ is determined by the cycle structure of each type. 
    The first class being the identity, with cycle (1)(2)(3)(4)(5). 
    Next, the class of all transposition. (ab)(c)(d)(e). The class of all three-cycle, (abc)(d)(e). 
    The class of all four-cycle, (abcd)(e). The class of all five-cycle (abcde). The class of all two two-cycles, (ab)(cd)(e).
    And lastly, the class of all two-and-three-cycles (ab)(cde). 

    Starting with the class of all transposition, there is $\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$ ways to choose 2 elements, thus, there is 10
    transpositions in the class. 

    For the class of three cycles, there is $\frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10$ ways to choose 3 elements, but the reversal gives another
    cycle, thus, totaling of 20 cycles in the class.

    For the class of four cycles, there is $5$ ways to choose 4 elements, but for each way, there is $3!$ permutation that gives 
    different cycles, thus, there is a total of 30 cycles in the class.

    For the class of five cycles, all elements can permutes in $4! = 24$ ways, each gives a different cycle, thus there is 24
    cycles in the class.

    Next, for the class of two two-cycles, there is $\frac{5!}{2!2!1!} = 30$ to choose the elements. 
    Since the each cycle is counted twice, the number of cycle in this class is $\frac{30}{2} = 15$ cycles. 

    Lastly, for the class of two-and-three cycles, there is $\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$ ways to form 2 and 3 groups, and each one 
    generate two different cycles, by the reversal of the three cycle. Thus, there is a total of 20 cycles in the group.

    To sum up, the class equation of $S_5$ is $5! = 120 = 1 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 24 + 15 + 20$, and the conjugacy class of $S_5$ is 
    as shown above.

    Show that $A_n$ has trivial center for $n \ge 4$.
  }
  \sol{
    For $n = 4$, the center of $A_4$ is the set $\set{z \mid zgz^{-1} = g \forall g \in A_4}$. 
    Consider the conjugacy class of $A_4$. As the conjugation preserves the cycle structure by a proof similar to
    claim~\ref{clm:conjcyc}, the class of $A_4$ are the identity class, class of $(a b c)$, and the class of $(a b)(c d)$.
    
    The class of $(a b c)$ has $\frac{4!}{3!1!} \times 2$ cycles and the class of $(a b)(c d)$ has $\frac{4!}{2!2! \cdot 2}$
    cycles.

    One can verify the correctness of the conjugation class by considering the class equation 
    \[ \abs{A_4} = 12 = 1 + 4\times2 + 3 \]. 
    Thus, there is only one element in the center.
    Therefore, the center is trivial.
    So, $A_4$ has trivial center.

    For $n \ge 5$, the group $A_n$ is simple. Since the center of $A_n$ is normal to $A_n$, then $Z(A_n) = \set{e}$ or 
    $Z(A_n) = A_n$. However, $A_n$ is not abelian. Therefore, $Z(A_n) \ne A_n$. Hence, it follows that $Z(A_n) = \set{e}$.

  \qs{}{
    Show that $A_n$ is the only nontrivial normal subgroup of $S_n$ for $n \ge 5$.
  }
  \sol{
    Consider a non-trivial normal subgroup $N$ of $S_n$ and assume that $N \ne A_n$. 
    It follows that $N \cap A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $A_n$. However, as $A_n$ is simple, $N \cap A_n = \set{e}$ or $A_n$.

    If $N \cap A_n = A_n$, then $A_n < N < S_n$. But it is impossible since $\abs{A_n} = \frac{\abs{S_n}}{2}$. Which means that 
    there is no integer value for $\abs{N}$ that would obey lagrange's theorem, given that $N \ne S_n$ and $N \ne A_n$.

    If $N \cap A_n = \set{e}$, then by the second isomorphism theorem, $NA_n/A_n \isom N/A_n\cap N \isom N$.
    However, as $N \ne A_n$ with $N \not< A_n$ (as $A_n$ is simple), and $[S_n: A_n] = 2$, then $NA_n = S_n$. 
    So, $S_n/A_n \isom \ZMod[2] \isom N$

    Thus, $\abs{N} = 2$. Notice that a subgroup of $S_n$ with order 2 are a subgroup containing just one transposition (and 
    identity). And since for any transposition $(a b)$, there is $c$ pairwise distinct to $a$ and $b$ such that 
    \[ (a c)(a b)(a c)^{-1} = (a c)(b a c) = (b c) \ne (a b) \]
    Thus, such group $N$ with order 2 cannot be normal. 

    Therefore, $A_n$ is the only normal subgroup of $S_n$ for $n \ge 5$.

    Consider $A_2$ is a trivial subgroup, thus $A_2 = [A_2, A_2]$ trivially.

    For $A_3$, $\abs{A_3} = 3$, thus $A_3 \isom \ZMod[3]$. Therefore, $A_3$ is abelian, hence for any $x, y \in A_3$, the 
    commutator $[x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = xx^{-1}yy^{-1} = e$. Making $[A_3, A_3] = \set{e} \ne A_3$

    For $A_4$, consider that a subgroup $N = \set{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (23)(14)}$ is a subgroup of $A_4$. This can 
    be shown using a multiplication table, or consider that the inverse of each element is itself, and that the product of 
    each pair is, without loss of generality, $(a b)(c d) \times (a c)(b d) = (a d)(b c)$. Therefore, $N$ is a subgroup of $A_4$.
    Moreover, since conjugation preserves the cycle structure as shown in claim~\ref{clm:conjcyc} and that 
    there is only $\frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3$ cycles of this type in $S_4$, the group $N$ is a normal 
    subgroup of $A_4$. Now, consider that $A_4/N$ is a group with order $12/4 = 3$, thus is a cyclic, which implies that 
    the group is abelian. Thus, the group $N$ must contains $[A_4, A_4]$ as it is the smallest group in which the quotient is 
    abelian. Thus, $[A_4, A_4] \ne A_4$. 

    For $n \ge 5$, it was shown in problem 1, $[A_n, A_n] \normSg A_n$. However, the only normal subgroup of $A_n$ 
    is the trivial subgroup $\set{e}$ and $A_n$ as $A_n$ is simple. Therefore, $[A_n, A_n] = A_n$ or $[A_n, A_n] = \set{e}$ 
    However, if $[A_n, A_n] = \set{e}$ then $A_n/[A_n, A_n]$ is isomorphic to $A_n$ which is not abelian, contradicts that 
    the quotient of the commutator group must always be abelian. Therefore, $A_n = [A_n, A_n]$.

    Therefore, $A_n$ is perfect for $n = 2$ and $n \ge 5$.

  \sol{
    As shown in claim~\ref{clm:conjcyc}, conjugation preserves the cycle structure. Notice that there is only 
    $\frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3$ possible permutations of this cycle type that are in $S_4$,
    which are all the element of $N$. Therefore, the conjugation $gNg^{-1} = N$ for any $g$. 
    This showed that $N$ is a normal subgroup of $S_4$.

    Now, notice that an element $g \in S_4$ is in one of the following form $e = id, (a b), (a b c), (a b c d), (a b)(c d)$
    For the element in the form of $(a b c)$, then it can be written as $(a b)(b c)$, $(b c)(c a)$, or equivalently, $(c a)(a b)$
    And if it is in the form $(a b c d)$, then it can be written as $(a b)(b c)(c d)$, $(b c)(c d)(d a)$, $(c d)(d a)(a b)$
    or equivalently, $(d a)(a b)(b c)$
    Therefore, an element of $S_4$ can be written as $\tau = \sigma (x 4)$ where $\sigma$ is a permutation that fixes $4$.

    As $N = \set{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (23)(14)}$, then if 
    \begin{gather*}
      \tau = \sigma (1 4) \implies \tau N = \sigma' N \text{ where } \sigma' = \sigma (2 3) \\ 
      \tau = \sigma (2 4) \implies \tau N = \sigma' N \text{ where } \sigma' = \sigma (1 3) \\

      \text{otherwise }, \tau N = \sigma' N \text{ where } \sigma' = \tau

    So there is an isomorphism from $S_4/N \to S_3$ via $\tau N \mapsto \sigma'$ defined above

    So, there must be a homomorphism from $\phi: G \to S_{x}$ corresponds to the action. Thus, by the first isomorphism theorem, 
    $G/\ker\phi \isom \im\phi$ and $\im\phi \vert S_x$, implying that $\abs{G} / \abs{\ker\phi} \vert x!$.
